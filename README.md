# ML Hear-disease project
> This project focuses on handling classification type problems
## Problem description
The idea of this project is to predict heart desise based on 13 attributes, these are:
1. age
2. sex
> (1 = male, 0 = female)
3. chest pain type (4 values)
> (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non - anginal pain; 4 = asymptomic)
4. resting blood pressure
5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
> (1 = True, 0 = False)
7. resting electrocardiographic results 
> (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)
8. maximum heart rate achieved
9. exercise induced angina
> (1 = yes, 0 = no)
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
> (Value1 = upsloping, Value2 = flat, Value3 = downsloping)
12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. Blood disorder called thalassemia
>(3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversable defect)
